With a background in physical education pedagogy, she started the first extra-curricular slackline program in an elementary public school in her home province of Ontario.

Well, when things feel too complex and paralyzing, I always like to think that my instincts and intuition will guide me in the right direction. Lately, time and time again, I've been pointed towards this pursuit of curating music for others, hopefully in a way that evokes emotion, movement, connection, and love. The onslaught of serotonin, dopamine, adrenaline, and any other happy hormone you can think of, which I feel while DJing, is beautifully addictive. I DJ to attain this compulsive feeling, which is why I also consider myself an artist in general. Whether I am DJing, making a movie, or doing anything artistic, I always try to attain this feeling in a wholesome and honest way.

I have been interested in health and wellness for 20+ years now.  Earlier years were based on more extreme approaches such as aerobic exercise (aerobics, zumba, etc) and strict diet protocols but has been transformed over time towards a more holistic approach including diet (Ayurveda/holistic), yoga, meditation, etc.  I was initially drawn to Breathe for the yoga (years back), but have found this to be a much more diverse and immersing event spiritually, physically and intellectually.  I would be so happy and honored to share some of the information and tools that I've learned along  the way.

This will be made vegan style to accommodate all.  Please stick around to taste and enjoy afterwards.   (Ayurveda in Sanskrit means the "knowledge of life" (ayur = life, veda = knowledge).

TBD - Musician friend - will submit by June 1st			Lunar Rhythms | moving with the moon	There's A Moon Inside My Body Kabir [1440-1518]  THE moon shines in my body, but my blind eyes cannot see it: The moon is within me, and so is the sun. The unstruck drum of Eternity is sounded within me; but my deaf ears cannot hear it.  So long as man clamours for the I and the Mine, his works are as naught: When all love of the I and the Mine is dead, then the work of the Lord is done. For work has no other aim than the getting of knowledge: When that comes, then work is put away.  The flower blooms for the fruit: when the fruit comes, the flower withers. The musk is in the deer, but it seeks it not within itself: it wanders in quest of grass.  Sarah has cultivated a personal and professional yoga practice mindful of moving with the astrological rhythms of the lunar phases. She's practiced this with many great friends and teachers before her. This practice has the subtle power to change one's body chemistry, allows one to feel more connected to nature and to one's true nature. This practice demands that one divest their energy from patriarchal and capitalist structures and expectations both physically, mentally and spiritually. This is not a shaming, bound, or rigid practice. It is the most liberating practice that has been shared with Sarah and she is overjoyed to share with you. If you're new to astrology or even just curious, this is a great way to be introduced to its endless information. If you're new to moving in your body or getting back to it, or even very athletic and embodied--This practice is made for you. Along with the theme of opening this year at breathe, Sarah invites you to open an autonomous, attuned, and compassionate relationship with your body and the world around you, both gravitationally bound to orbit a tiny rock in a giant space.

The road to being more comfortable with vulnerability and confidence in your own skin is not a linear. Some days will be better than others! I specialize in using breath work and meditation to exercise peoples comfortability with being vulnerable. As a trans, bi-racial man I often find it difficult to find a sense of belonging in any given community. I have also found it difficult to feel comfortable taking up space in my own skin. By opening up and practicing vulnerability exercises that simply allow me to spend time with myself, my quality of life has increased significantly.

Immerse yourself in an environment void of sight and sound as you learn to communicate with yourself and your surroundings in a way that encourages confidence and learning. Learn to trust yourself, the environment, and others as you are blindfolded and guided around camp toward familiar objects like a slackline, grass, a chair etc. Not being able to see or communicate verbally with your surrounding environment allows you to explore the feeling of confidently taking up space in your own skin.

Taylor, more commonly known simply as 'Taylor', has been teaching, performing, and recording West African percussion since 1994. Early on, he noticed the power of energetic shifts and out-of-body experiences that would occur in/with him during drumming with the djembe; soon after, created the DRUMeditation so that others could bask in the same energy.  He has provided drumming for his own rituals as well as those of the great Master Diviner Dr. Malidoma Somé.  Through his work with Dr Some, he has learned of his relationship to the realm of ancestors via the djembe; a realm of collective knowledge and healing that extends back through the ages.    Separately, after beginning studies with Grand Master Drummer Mamady Keita in 2001, he achieved the degrees of Tam Tam Mandingue Djembe Academy Instructor (2005) and TTMDA Senior Instructor (2006); he is the Director of TTMDA-Chicago.  Through TTMDA he teaches and performs with and for youth ages 5-105. The founder and driving force behind Holy Goat Percussion, he imports, sells and repairs West African djembes and dununs. Additionally, he recorded all djembe parts on the Djembeföla! App for IOS.  He is proud to be a “messenger of tradition” in representing TTMDA.  Check 'djembist' on YouTube for video examples.		Olina Dolly			DRUMeditation	Created by Taylor in the late 1990s, the DRUMeditation™ is a combination of guided meditation and rhythmic environments in the form of drums, bells, shakers, flutes, voices, etc., played by Taylor, resulting in a powerful transformative experience designed to open your mind, spirit and body, so that you may be receptive to internal and external healing.  He has provided drumming for his own rituals as well as those of the great Master Diviner Dr. Malidoma Somé. Through his work with Dr Some, he has learned of his relationship to the realm of ancestors via the djembe; a realm of collective knowledge and healing that extends back through the ages.    Imagine this scene: you are lying down in a room, in savasana (in Yoga they call it corpse pose; lying on your back in total relaxation). You are surrounded by other people lying about, all heads pointed toward Taylor. As he gives basic instructions, sets expectations with you and guides you into a relaxed state, the instruments (drums, bells, shakers, flute, voice(s), etc) create a sonic backdrop, a rhythmic environment, which will be the magic carpet which will help transport you, while Taylor channels the ancestors. You decide how deep you go; you decide where you go and why; you decide what to do with your experience. Few leave the DRUMeditation™ experience untouched; most leave it profoundly moved.  It is very important to bring things that will help you be comfortable lying down (in savasana), like yoga mat(s), blankets, bolsters, pillows.   													https://drive.google.com/open?id=1TUdA2pxVuaGsQX9gi1ku4K8zeSrPMPhi

Six States of Autonomic Nervous System Activation 	I believe that healing takes place when we are understood, accepted, and loved for who we are. Who we are involves our minds and our bodies. We are not understood deeply just by the words that we speak, which is why we have to also engage the body to heal on a deeper level that attends to our nervous system experience.

Letting Go of Perfectionism and Form in Yoga	Functional Anatomy with Matt Eshleman, YACEP, ERYT500 (This workshop qualifies participants for YA CEUs) What if I told you your body is perfect?

Using both anatomical models and living breathing examples drawn from our group, feel empowered to move beyond aesthetic concerns and toward a Functional Approach.

Parallel study of Eastern wisdom traditions led Matt to pursue teaching yoga as a full-time profession in 2002, first studying Ashtanga Vinyasa with Larry Schultz, founder of It’s Yoga, and then Yin Yoga and Functional Anatomy with Paul and Suzee Grilley. Drawing further from Grilley’s teachers Paulie Zink and Dr. Motoyama, Matt integrates these studies into what can best be called Taoist Yoga. Matt is also a practitioner of martial arts, holding the rank of Shodan at Jissenkan Dojo in Cincinnati OH. Balancing martial training with the study of the therapeutic healing arts of Thai Yoga massage, QiGong, and Reiki, Matt brings to his teachings a very practical knowledge of the physical and energetic systems of the body. In 2016, Matt joined the elite ranks of YogaSlackers Teachers, and also enjoys teaching Slackline and AcroYoga. Matt is an avid fan of the outdoors, and enjoys rock-climbing, highlining, flying airplanes, anything on water, and all kinds of flow arts. Continuing studies have also given Matt opportunities to participate in anatomy, kinesiology, and cadaver dissection courses at Marquette University. Matt currently travels the US in a rainbow bus named Mahayana leading unique educational experiences. Matt is also the father of two amazing daughters who love to attend festivals.					 Basics of Aikido - Keeping the Peace.	Many people associate martial arts with violence, but its roots are actually in preventing conflict. A fundamental principle of the aikido tradition of martial arts is balance - keeping yours while depriving a potential opponent of their own. If done well, this prevents aggression from ever taking place, and rather than inciting violence it is actually a peacekeeping strategy. Learn about your own posture, footing, and movement - then take these principles to simple partner exercises to embody the concepts in practice.													https://drive.google.com/open?id=1TUdA2pxVuaGsQX9gi1ku4K8zeSrPMPhi

Matt Eshleman			Flow with the Art of Capoeira: A game, a dance and a form of self-defense direct from Brasil.	This workshop will teach you the basic movements of Capoeira Art and it's music rhythms.  Sometimes referred to as a martial art, sometimes a dance and sometimes even a game, capoeira is a unique phenomenon that has caught the attention of the world in recent years. It’s instantly recognizable thanks to a singular, eye-catching style and it's movements can be also used as reference and inspiration for other movement forms.  It has been suggested capoeira was created during the 16th century by enslaved people who were taken from West Africa to Brazil by Portuguese colonists. Prohibited from celebrating their cultural customs and forbidden from practicing martial arts, it’s thought capoeira emerged as a way to bypass these two imposing laws. Hidden in the musical and rhythmic elements of the form, violent kicks and acrobatic movements were disguised as passionate dance movements and its combination of West African cultures saved it from being identified as an attempt to preserve any specific tradition. As such, capoeira came to life as a survival tool, not only of self-defense, but also of cultural identity. 													https://drive.google.com/open?id=1TUdA2pxVuaGsQX9gi1ku4K8zeSrPMPhi

At the age of sixteen I began to study yoga having a book as guide. I practiced for nearly five years on my own and with the same book as only instructor. It wasn’t until I moved out of Cuba at the age of twenty that I participated in a group yoga class. I found yoga searching for tools to cope with anxiety. The ancient art and its discipline connected me to energies in my body I had never felt before. Yoga has been an essential part of my life ever since.  At the beginning of 2013 I completed my first Yoga Teacher training and became certified by the worldwide Yoga Alliance for the 200 hours standard for Registered Yoga Schools (RYS), internationally recognized from the Yoga Vedanta Forest Academy of Rishikesh and the Sivananda Yoga Vedanta Centres and Ashrams. I was initiated into the Sivananda lineage for which I have a great love and respect. After all these years of teaching and studying the Sivananda school remains the foundation of my teachings although incorporating a taste of other schools of yoga. I have learned from some of the greatest teachers and masters of our times including Sri Dharma Mittra, Sharon Gannon and Gurmukh Kaur Khalsa.    While studying Kriya Yoga in Rishikesh, India in 2016 I had the honor to meet Mother Ganga and to incorporate Swami Chidanand Saraswati blessings and environmental awareness into my teachings. At the end of 2021 I completed a bachelor’s degree in Sustainability and The Environment at Florida International University in Miami. I’m a yoga teacher, an environmentalist and a vegan activist.   					The Art of Balance-A Sustainable Approach To Yoga	This workshop will incorporate a blend of philosophical approaches to yoga connecting them to essential sustainability principles, a series of traditional pranayama (control of prana/breathing exercises) and plenty of physical movement. Fallow by a long relaxation rooted on yoga Nidra (psychic sleep) principles. Everyone is welcome because everyone is constantly searching for balance, but often in the wrong places.

My work can be found in the 2011 movie Contagion starring Matt Damon, Kate Winslet and Jude Law. As for academic credentials, I have a MSc in computational biology, an MBA and I'm an Adjunct Professor of Data Analytics.  I've worked for one of the largest biotech companies in world, and I’ve represented them at the largest genetics conference in the world.  I've worked at one of the top medical schools in the USA as well at NASA.  As part of the “Global Infectious Disease division (GID)”, I cultured and worked on cures for infectious diseases that kill millions per year.  I have spent most of my life working with infectious diseases, genomics and the related cutting edge technology. 					The Psychology, History & Technology of Pandemics, Covid & Biological Warfare 	Some of these topics will not be for the faint of heart. Mark Twain once said: "History never repeats itself, but it does often rhyme". I believe it's important to learn from history to more gracefully navigate through the future.  We will focus on the psychology of pandemics throughout history. Interestingly, certain patterns of human behavior are immutable and often repeat themselves time and time again. We will highlight some of these patterns of human behavior throughout history. The wisdom and teachings of timeless scientists and legends such as physicist Carl Sagan, psychologist Carl Jung, a few Nobel Laureates and few top government officials will be analyzed. We will also explore virus technology, from the Japanese experimenting on humans in WW2, to what’s currently cutting edge technology today. This will help us understand why the former director of the CDC, Robert Redfield, believes a “Great Pandemic”, which will be “much more brutal than COVID”, is ahead of us and not behind us. Finally, we will explore how we can weather future storms with more skill, understanding and grace for our fellow man.

You can now find me in the park most evenings slacking, juggling, and hanging out with friends with my mini aussie, Cash. 					Slacking 101 - Fundamentals	Whether you have never stepped on a slack line before or you just started and are working on your first steps, this is the workshop for you! I will be going over all the tips and tricks that have helped me progress my slack lining skills.   Body positions, mindset, how to fall safely, BREATHING, and more will be covered in this workshop to help you take more steps and move on to longer lines!													https://drive.google.com/open?id=1TUdA2pxVuaGsQX9gi1ku4K8zeSrPMPhi

Due to my dedication in my woodworking and 3D art classes, I was offered a position at the university as the teacher's assistant for the woodworking classes and as the open lab tecnitian in the wood studio to assist students with their projects and enforce proper safety while students used power tools. I love sharing the knowlege I collected about safe wood working and 3D art. 		Angel Rivera (this might change due to scheduling)			Make your paintings pop! Canvas Framing	 This workshop will teach participants the nuances of framing canvases. Properly framed canvases require custom frames since all canvases have unique corner folds. We will demonstrate proper canvas framing while also talking about proper safety procedures when working with certain power tools. If participants wish to bring their own canvases, we will select one or more of them to frame in the demonstration rather than our own for attendees to take home. We can even make a frame for a blank canvas that you can remove from the frame to paint later. If we get paintings that are finished, we can pick specific woods that will compliment the pieces!													https://drive.google.com/open?id=1TUdA2pxVuaGsQX9gi1ku4K8zeSrPMPhi

Alan is in a constant state of open mindedness, self-improvement, and reflection.   Growing up in a diverse lower-class community, he learned the impact of positive mentorship and role models who are credited with saving his life. Driven by his experiences, Alan has made deliberate choices to actively engage with numerous local and international philanthropic organizationswith the intention of helping as many people as possible.   Despite holding positions as a pilot, civil engineer, drone pilot, and investor, he derives the greatest satisfaction from immersing himself in the needs of others, exploring different countries, and responsibly assisting individuals in their personal growth journeys. 					Reimagine Exploration: The Essential Workshop on Ethical World Travel	This workshop is intended to help discuss, educate, and debate the pros and cons of international travel, particularly focusing on conscious travel, often referred to as voluntourism. Several engaging and open-ended topics will be addressed, providing you with the opportunity to participate actively if you choose, although there's no obligation to do so.  After introductions, you'll learn about the transformative role of local host organizations in Tanzania and Laos. We will discuss how these organizations have altered lives, creating sustainable, non-dependent, and positive impacts on both the local villagers and the international participants.  Not familiar with Tanzania and Laos? Don't worry! Before I volunteered, my knowledge about these countries was minimal. One reason why I'm thrilled to contribute to this workshop is because it's a unique opportunity to discuss interesting, shocking, and astonishing historical facts not typically included in U.S. textbooks. With that in mind, note our discussion will remain respectful of the unique cultures mentioned.  Special emphasis will be placed on the following discussion points:  • Affordable world travel and cost-effective travel techniques • Cultural immersion • Voting with your dollar • Education, complacency, and self-reflection • Compassion and empathy  We will wrap up this workshop with concepts that will empower you to help promote a more just, sustainable, and interconnected world. 													https://drive.google.com/open?id=1TUdA2pxVuaGsQX9gi1ku4K8zeSrPMPhi
